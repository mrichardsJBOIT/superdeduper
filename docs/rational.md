# Why Super De Duper?

*It wasn't my fault, I promise, I was just following instructions...*

## Coding Exercise
    We recommend completing the exercise in either Ruby, Javascript, .Net or Java  
    as these are the languages you will be mostly working in here at Cogent.   
    If you don't feel comfortable with these, please let us know and we can work something out.

## Instructions:

> A client merged their home photo folder with their partner's folder, with disastrous consequences. They now have a lot of duplicate photos in different places in the folder structure.
> They've attached a .zip of this photos folder to this email.
> Write a command-line program in your chosen language which finds files which have exactly the same contents and outputs any duplicates (and their locations) to standard output.

## Requirements:
* In your implementation, only use the standard libraries of your chosen language. No shelling out, or using external services or libraries.
* You are free to use external libraries for the purposes of testing.
* The code should be readable, reusable, easy to modify and well tested. We're looking for production-quality code that is test driven.

**Consider the the following points in formulating your solution:**
* What if this same solution was used on a really large set of photos? What if it was a thousand photos? Or tens of thousands?
* What if this was a three-way merge, with triplicates? Does your solution account for this?
* Some of these files may have had their filename changed.
* Some of these may have only their extension changed.


    Your code should be of production quality, and demonstrate the idioms of your chosen language.

    Please submit a zipped git repository, with a readme, and let us know in the Notes section which language you've used.

    I will keep an eye out for your submission and will come back to you with feedback and next steps after we review it with the team.
    
    Thanks and talk soon,
