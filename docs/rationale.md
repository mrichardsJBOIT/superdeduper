# Why Super De Duper?

*It wasn't my fault, I promise, I was just following instructions...*

## Instructions:

> A client merged their home photo folder with their partner's folder, with disastrous consequences. They now have a lot of duplicate photos in different places in the folder structure.
> They've attached a .zip of this photos folder to this email.
> Write a command-line program in your chosen language which finds files which have exactly the same contents and outputs any duplicates (and their locations) to standard output.

## Requirements:

* In your implementation, only use the standard libraries of your chosen language. No shelling out, or using external services or libraries.
* You are free to use external libraries for the purposes of testing.
* The code should be readable, reusable, easy to modify and well tested. We're looking for production-quality code that is test driven.

**Consider the the following points in formulating your solution:**
* What if this same solution was used on a really large set of photos? What if it was a thousand photos? Or tens of thousands?
* What if this was a three-way merge, with triplicates? Does your solution account for this?
* Some of these files may have had their filename changed.
* Some of these may have only their extension changed.


    Your code should be of production quality, and demonstrate the idioms of your chosen language.
